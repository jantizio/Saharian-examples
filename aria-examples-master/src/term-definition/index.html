      accessibility degrees, implemented both by using native HTML Elements and
      attributes from the WAI-ARIA specification.

              A fragrant, grape-based pomace brandy of Italian origin that
              contains 35 to 60 percent Alcohol by volume (70 to 120 US proof).
              Its flavor depends on the type and quality of the grapes used, as
              well as the specifics of the distillation process. It is made by
              distilling the skins, pulp, seeds, and stems (i.e. the pomace
              leftover from winemaking after pressing the grapes.)
