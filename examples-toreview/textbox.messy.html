    <h1>Messy single line textbox with no keyboard support</h1>
    <p class="help">
      This is a messed up ARIA single line textbox implementation with a label and help text that:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>doesn't provide the expected keyboard support;</li>
      <li>exposes to assistive technologies an invalid relationship to its label and description, referencing objects
        that
        do not exist in the DOM.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="warning"><strong><em>Important: <code>contenteditable</code> is used as a dirty hack to avoid messing with
          the caret in a custom text field, which is "way too much more complicated" than it should be :(. Other hacks
          have been put in place to overcome (many) browser quirks.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Due to the fact that this specific implementation leverages the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute, browsers
      and assistive technologies might not exhibit the described issues.
