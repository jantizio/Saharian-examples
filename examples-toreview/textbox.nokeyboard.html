    <h1>Single line textbox with no keyboard support</h1>
    <p class="help">
      This is a single line textbox implementation with a label and help text that doesn't provide the expected keyboard
      support:
    <ul>
      <li>the textbox is not keyboard focusable;</li>
      <li>pressing enter when the textbox is focused won't send its value.</li>
    </ul>
    </p>
    <p class="warning"><strong><em>Important: <code>contenteditable</code> is used as a dirty hack to avoid messing with
          the caret in a custom text field, which is "way too much more complicated" than it should be :(. Other hacks
          have
          been put in place to overcome (many) browser quirks.</em></strong>
    </p>
    <p class="warning">
      Due to the fact that this specific implementation leverages the <code>contenteditable</code> attribute, browsers
      and assistive technologies might not exhibit the described issues.
